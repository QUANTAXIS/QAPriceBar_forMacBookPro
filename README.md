The app runs in background and has no visible icon on the dock. To quit the app, please use Activity Monitor, search for the CoinPriceBar process and terminate it.

## "Please support this coin / this currency"

I don't have much spare time as I used to so I am no longer be able to customize the app for you but it is easy to do that on your own. Have a look at the files [Data.swift](CoinPriceBar/Data.swift) and [Money.swift](CoinPriceBar/Money.swift). The code should be self-explained and you should be able to modify it to fit your needs.
